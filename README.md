# file-compression-and-decompression-using-huffman-coding
#Overview

This project implements file compression and decompression using Huffman Encoding, a popular algorithm for lossless data compression. The goal is to reduce the size of files by encoding them in a way that more frequent characters have shorter codes, while less frequent characters have longer codes.

#Features

Compression: Reduces the file size by encoding the data using Huffman codes.
Decompression: Restores the original file from the compressed data.
